# SamudraSetu - Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting

This is a Next.js project created in Firebase Studio. It's a comprehensive platform for crowdsourcing, visualizing, and analyzing ocean hazard information to protect coastal communities.

## Getting Started Locally

To run this project on your local machine using Visual Studio Code, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** (which includes **npm**) installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Unzip and Open Project

1.  Unzip the downloaded project folder.
2.  Open Visual Studio Code, then go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the unzipped project folder.

### 3. Set Up Environment File

The project requires an API key for Google Maps.

1.  In the root of the project, find the `.env` file.
2.  Ensure it contains your Google Maps API key, like so:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`) and run this command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Application

The application requires two services to run at the same time: the Next.js web app and the Genkit AI server. You will need two separate terminals for this.

**Terminal 1: Start the Web App**

In your first terminal, run the following command to start the main application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your website will be available at **http://localhost:9002**.

**Terminal 2: Start the AI Server**

Open a second terminal in VS Code (click the `+` icon in the terminal panel). In this new terminal, run the following command to start the AI services:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

This server handles all the AI-powered features, such as image analysis and authenticity scoring. The web app automatically communicates with this server.

You are now all set! Open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to see your application running.
